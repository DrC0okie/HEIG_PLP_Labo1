-- Tar - simple compression tool
-- Authors: Samuel Roland and TimothÃ©e Van Hove
-- Description: Compression is made with basic RLE algorithm, it will compress AAAABBBCCDAA into 4A3B2C1D2A, and is able to decompress 3X5F to XXXFFFFF
-- Features and limits: The compression must support numbers, not only digits, i.e. 345X is a valid compressed string that is a list of 345 times the X letter.
-- there is no support for compressing strings including digits
-- as there is no easy way during decompression to differentiate a counter from a char to repeat.
-- We don't support negative nor null counters
-- When there is any detection of invalid situations, we never want to return a result, we want to fail with an error

-- Goal: compressing a string X and decompressing the result must come back to X,
-- and vice-versa: decompressing a compressed string Y, compressing the result must give Y again,
-- there is a coherence to respect in terms of errors generation on both sides

-- Edge cases on compression
-- 1. Detecting a digit (i.e. in "AAAABBB999") will throw an error because this is not supported and will generate incoherent decompressions
-- 2. An empty string will be compressed to an empty string: "" -> ""

-- Edge cases on decompression
-- 1. Detecting a char without any counter before (i.e. with B in "3AB") will throw an error
-- 2. Detecting a counter without any char after (i.e. with 5 in "4B5") will throw an error, we could interpret it as 5 times nothing but the compression result of "BBBB" will give "4B" not "4B5" so it would be incoherent
-- 3. A counter equal to 0 (i.e. in "0b5a") must throw an error

-- Conventions:
-- 1. n is used for the counter (the number before a char in the compressed version)
-- 2. acc means accumulator, we use to avoid real recursion by having a tail recursion that will be optimized

-- Complexity: we only used ++ where it would not create situations of O(N^2) therefore the rlec and rled are in O(N)
-- to achieve this, we had to push values in front of accumulators and reverse them at the end.
-- These accumulators cannot just be strings, they have to be a list of string because it is harder to reverse it correctly otherwise (for multi digits numbers mostly).
-- All functions are in tail-recursion style for performance and safety

-- Tests: we have a test suite inside file tests.fish where all edge cases documented above have been tested.
